# R_assessment

Team Name: GIT 'ER DONE 

PLAN: 

Experience working in a research team: 
- Ella: Worked with postdocs, wrote her own reports 
- Simona: Wet lab w phds, postdocs, PI and undergrads (diverse); would work on sub aspects of projects
- Sophie: Reproducible coding 

How to divide up tasks for analysis: 
- Import + Process (cleaning, encoding): Sophie 
- Analyse (1 script): Collab editing
- Generate plots/tables: Ella (R markdown) 
- Report

- Split up less individually because we are working on it together - would be different if we were working remotely/at different times
